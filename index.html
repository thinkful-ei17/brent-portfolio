         I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Front End Web Development Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful.I love coding
        because solving problems and seeing ideas come to life on the page is supremely satisfying.I geek out on higher order functions,
        finding and learning awesome libraries or frameworks, and getting front and back ends to play nicely. When Im not coding,
        Im often found on Skype working with clients, curled up in a cozy chair reading, hiking in a canyon, or upside down doing
        a headstand.I am lifelong learner and my current learning projects include piano and writing my first book.
